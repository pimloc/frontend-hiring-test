## Instructions

Your overall aim of the app is to make something that looks good. The main goal of this task is to demonstrate your ability to style a good UI/UX. Do not priortise getting all these features into your app.

- Render the boxes located in `./src/defaultState.js` onto the image. The box coordinates are given as percentages of the image height/width.
- Display the image in a view that adapts to screen size
- Create a button to allow the user to add a new box in a random position
- Allow the user to click on a box and render the box attributes (position, id, etc.) below the image
(- Create a button to allow the user to delete the box they most recently clicked on)
(- Allow the user to change the title shown at the top. Perhaps an edit button that opens an input)

Don't worry about implementing all the features listed. You should only spend 90mins to 2 hours on the task. Feel free to google any resources you need, this isn't a test of knowledge.
